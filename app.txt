Alternative Option: Force Push (Not Recommended)
If you are sure that your local changes should overwrite the remote changes and you do not want to merge, you can force push (though be careful as this will overwrite any remote changes):

bash
Copy code
git push --force origin master
However, this is not recommended unless you're sure it wonâ€™t affect other collaborators or the remote repository's history.
